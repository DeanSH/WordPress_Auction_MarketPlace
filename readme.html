WordPress Auction Website for Berries NZ.

Using a customized and modified child of the SiteMile auction theme.

Created for an Assessment in WEB701 at NMIT during my Degree for a BIT.

You-Tube demonstration of the Website here: https://youtu.be/GDmeY6qjM1k

Website built locally and not pushed to live hosting.
Testing will require DB setup from the localhost.sql file for MySQL,
and copying the auction folder webfiles to host locally with the likes of Xampp.

Accounts:
Admin : 123456
Hayden : 123456 << Berry Seller (Grower) & Buyer account, all accounts are 2 in 1.

Admin is for the site owner and gives access to the Wordpress back end.

Hayden is a registered user who grows, all users can buy or sell berries.

The brief did not say Growers and Customers have to register separately,
Or be identified separately in the website, so therefore its only 1 dashboard, 
and the Dashboard shows both buying & selling features to all users,
exactly like trade me. From the dashboard Growers and/or Customers can
manage there accounts, auctions, watchlist, bidding etc.

Berry Calculator is found in the first section of adding a new auction,
as an option to click for price help right under the buy now price input!

Growers or resellers can add auctions, Customers can bid on auctions,
as required by the brief, If a Customer will add an auction then it is
Automatically assumed that Customer is a Grower or Reseller of Berries.

Home page has berries information, featured auctions, closing soon & latest.
The featured auctions scrolls automatically to interactively attract buyers.
